# Chloe Koala
Chatbot powered by OpenAI's Davinci GPT-3 model.

This is just another just-for-fun project. Chloe Koala is a child-friendly chatbot. I made her as a sort of companion for shy kids who want to practice their social skills. A fun challenge was coming up with a band-aid fix for the goldfish memory issue, which still isn't quite there yet.
